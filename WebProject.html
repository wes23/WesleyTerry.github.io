<P> I am a sophmore at the University of Georgia. This is my first semester at UGA. I transferred from Kennesaw State. I am a sports management major. I am looking to minor in entrepreneurship. I am looking to be able to get a good job in
a NFL front office, or become a sports agent. I am also into college sports, and I am a big UGA football fan. </P> 

<P> Over the summer, I work for Perfect Game. Perfect Game is a baseball organization that involves high school baseball
players looking to be recruited. I work the front gate, and handle all of the ring sizes for championship rings, and make 
sure all money is accounted for. </P> 

<P> Pi Kappa Phi is a fraternity here at UGA. I joined this semester, and there are a lot of interesting positive qualities to 
a fraternity. As a member, you know so many people instantly, and know so many things about a person. Fraternities also bring
a good social aspect where you can meet other people not in your organization like sororities.</P>
